# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
* I feel pretty confident with them. It is something I'm familiar with from other programming languages, so conceptually I think I already feel pretty comfortable.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
* Again, pretty comfortable, since its a familiar concept already.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
* This one was a little more tricky, since there's some fun syntactical stuff I have to remember (that gosh darn end keyword haha.) But conceptually, again, something I was already familiar with.

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
* I probably spent 1.5-2 hours on it? It was definitely more extensive than I was thinking based on having done the array lessons this morning. I spent a lot of time thinking about the git commits and things like that as well. The video part of the challenge took me way longer than it should have probably.

1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
* I think this lesson felt pretty comfortable. Hopefully i'm just not completely misunderstanding and have done things wrong. If not though, I do feel pretty comfortable with these topics since they are already familiar to me!

1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
* I have some questions about when you can use methods or the ? syntax I've been seeing around the internet when looking up some ruby stuff up. For example in the mild challenge I used `if number.even?` instead of `if number % 2 == 0` which is what I would have done in the past (or if I hadn't googled even/odd Ruby).
